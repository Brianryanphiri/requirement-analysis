# üß© Requirement Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs, goals, and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It helps ensure that developers and clients have a clear, shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should function.

In the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, requirement analysis serves as the foundation of all subsequent stages ‚Äî design, development, testing, and deployment ‚Äî by transforming vague ideas into well-defined system requirements.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC for several reasons:

1. **Clarity and Understanding:**
   It ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system requirements, reducing confusion and miscommunication.

2. **Reduces Project Risks and Costs:**
   Identifying and resolving requirement issues early helps avoid costly rework and delays later in the project.

3. **Guides Development and Testing:**
   Clear requirements provide a roadmap for developers and a reference point for testers to verify that the software meets expectations.

4. **Improves Project Planning:**
   Well-defined requirements make it easier to estimate timelines, resources, and budgets accurately.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering:**
   Collecting needs and expectations from users, clients, and stakeholders using interviews, questionnaires, or observations.

2. **Requirement Elicitation:**
   Engaging with stakeholders to uncover detailed functional and non-functional requirements through workshops, brainstorming sessions, or focus groups.

3. **Requirement Documentation:**
   Recording the gathered information in a structured format such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**
   Studying, refining, and modeling the documented requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible.

5. **Requirement Validation:**
   Verifying that the documented requirements align with stakeholder needs and business objectives before development begins.

## Types of Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do** ‚Äî the specific actions, features, and functions it must perform.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**

* Users should be able to **create an account** and **log in**.
* The system should allow customers to **search for available rooms** by date and location.
* Users should be able to **book a room** and **receive a confirmation message**.
* The admin should be able to **view, update, and delete bookings**.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system performs** ‚Äî its quality attributes, constraints, and operational characteristics.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**

* The system should handle **up to 1,000 concurrent users**.
* The booking confirmation should be sent within **5 seconds** of payment.
* The platform should maintain **99.9% uptime**.
* The system should be **secure**, ensuring all user data is encrypted.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and accepted by the client or stakeholder. They define the expected behavior, helping both developers and testers understand when a requirement is fully satisfied.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Importance:

* Ensures features meet business and user needs.
* Provides measurable and testable standards.
* Reduces ambiguity between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

### üí° Example: Checkout Feature

**Feature:** Room Checkout

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The user must be able to view a summary of their booking before checkout.
* The system should display the total price including taxes and discounts.
* Payment options (credit card, PayPal, mobile money) should be available.
* Once payment is successful, a confirmation message and receipt should be sent via email.
* If payment fails, the user should receive a clear error message and retry option.
