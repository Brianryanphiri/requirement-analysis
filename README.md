### üß© What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs or expectations of users, stakeholders, and the business for a software system. It is one of the most important phases in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for how the software will function and what it must achieve.

During requirement analysis, developers, business analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to understand **what the system should do**, the **problems it aims to solve**, and the **constraints** under which it must operate.

#### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:

1. **Gathering Requirements:** Collecting needs from users, customers, and stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observations.
2. **Analyzing Requirements:** Studying the collected information to identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps.
3. **Documenting Requirements:** Creating clear and structured documentation such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).
4. **Validating Requirements:** Ensuring that all requirements are realistic, testable, and aligned with business goals.

#### üí° Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

* It ensures **clear understanding** between the client and development team.
* Helps in **avoiding misunderstandings** and costly changes later in the project.
* Provides a **strong foundation** for design, development, and testing phases.
* Improves **project planning**, cost estimation, and time management.
* Ensures that the final software **meets user expectations** and business needs.

In summary, **Requirement Analysis** is the backbone of successful software development ‚Äî it transforms vague ideas into precise, actionable requirements that guide the entire project.
